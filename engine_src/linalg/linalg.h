/*
* Contains all includes for the linear algebra package built

*
* Should not be used too extensively. It is recommended to include only the
* linalg classes necessary to shorten build times.
*
* Packages include:
*   - Vectors (2D, 3D and 4D)
*   - Matrices (2D, 3D and 4D)
*   - Quaternions
*
* Most common operations are supported or will be supported.
