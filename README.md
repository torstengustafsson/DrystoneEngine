# Drystone Game Engine

This game engine is built on top of SDL2, and can be used to create various games. This is a hobby project I work on in my spare time.

To install it on your machine, you need the latest version of cmake. Installation is super simple:

1. run cmake on the project
2. open the generated solution and build
3. run any of the demo games to make sure it works!

I have focused on working on Windows with Visual Studio, but I plan on making it work for Linux as well!

I put instructions on how to use the game engine in
